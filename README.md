# CAR_SUPERVISING BASE ON OBD2 & GPS
# Overview
Build a simple car data monitoring system using data from GPS signals and the car's OBD2 messages. This is the high-level diagram of the entire system I've designed; however, my work only covers the upper branch (the red branch).

# Hardware Components And Required Knowledge
+ ESP8266 Microcontroller -- The foundation knowledge about ESP8266, the architecth of MCU. 
+ Module GPS Neo-6M       -- Pinout diagram and how it works.
+ Module MCP2515          -- CAN, SPI, pinout diagram. Because this is main module of this project you should reference datasheet of MCP2515.
+ OBD2 Connector          -- OBD2 Standard and basic knowledge about automobile.
In addition, you must know how to create a realtime database on Firebase and if you are good at IDE tool like VScode, PlatformIO, you will easily install and building this project

*Note: Just a result I want to show you.
